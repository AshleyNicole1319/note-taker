# Project 11: Express.js Challenge
## Note Taker
This is an easy-to-use note-taking web application that is intended for users to write, save, and delete notes. Note Taker is supported by an Express.js back end, and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

## Installation
To install, clone this repository to your local folders. Node.js and Express.js must be installed in order to proceed. 
In terminal, run `npm start` and then, in your browser, go to `http://localhost:3001` 

The application should run from there.

## Usage
To create a new note, click the `+` icon in the top-right corner. Once a title and note content are added, a save icon will appear in the top right. Click the save icon, and your new note will now be on your list. In your list of notes, a red trash can will be visible, click this if you want to delete a note.
