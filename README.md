## Installation
To install, clone this repository to your local folders. Node.js and Express.js must be installed in order to proceed. 
In terminal, run `npm start` and then, in your browser, go to `http://localhost:3001` 

The application should run from there.

## Usage
To create a new note, click the `+` icon in the top-right corner. Once a title and note content are added, a save icon will appear in the top right. Click the save icon, and your new note will now be on your list. In your list of notes, a red trash can will be visible, click this if you want to delete a note.
