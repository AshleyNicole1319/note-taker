## Installation
1. To install this application for local development, `git clone` this repository, or download the `.zip` file in the dropdown after clicking the green ‘Code’ button at the top of this repository—as long as it is in your local branch.
2. Ensure Node.js is installed in your code editor of choice.
3. Install [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) node package by entering the following in the command line of terminal:
```
npm i express
```
4. Run `npm start` and open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3001`

## Usage
This application is fairly straightforward. A new note can be added by clicking the `+` icon in the top-right corner of the page. The user will need to enter a note title and its content in order for the save icon to appear next to the `+` icon. The saved note will appear in the left column, along with other previously saved notes. Each saved entry will display a red `delete` button in the side column so that the note can be deleted.
